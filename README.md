# Software_Intern_Imperial
This repository contains code from my software engineering research internship in the Mech Eng department of Imperial, Summer 2019. 
The goal of the internship was to create an extension for the 'Slicer' program so that 3-D models of skulls can be imported. 
Viable syringe entry points are then calculated and displayed so that the syringe can be inserted in to the skull. 
NOTE: The code shown was given to me and is the work of a PhD student. I was simply asked to manipulate the code to build the program extension,
my main contribution being lines 663-751 of 'EDEN_tract_planner.py'.
